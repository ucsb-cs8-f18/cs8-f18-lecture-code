<p>In the code at the top of page 104, this line is included twice:<br>
<code>data = input("Enter a number or just enter to quit: ")</code><br>
<p>Why is it included twice (once before the loop and once inside the loop)? What would the program do if the one at the bottom were removed?</p>
++
<p>What is the problem in the following code?</p>
<pre>
x = 5
y = 10
while x > 1:
  y -= 1
</pre>
